## Guidelines for contributors

* Use **italian** function and variable names
* Try to split a bigger work in little commits, in order to bisect easier eventual bugs
* **Do write comments** using Javadoc for every function, plus extra documentation inside functions if needed
* Name interfaces with a leading capital 'I', in order to avoid ambiguity with classes (es. *ICollection*)
* Have a question? Want to ask confirmation before adding a feature? Create an issue with the tag 'discussion'!
